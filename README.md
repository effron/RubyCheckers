Make sure to intsall the colorize gem in order to use this version of checkers.

If you want to use checkers.rb (instead of checkers_plain.rb), install the everson font and use it in your terminal. 
Find it here: http://www.evertype.com/emono/

To run the program, download the .rb files and type "ruby checkers.rb" or "ruby checkers_plain.rb" in your terminal.

Enjoy!
